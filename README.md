# Challenge 12: Employee Tracker 

## Description
This challenge requires the development of an employee tracker database that will be a command-line application that accepts user input. When a user starts the application, the user will be presented with a list of the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role. When a user chooses to view all departments, roles, or employees, the user is presented with a formatted table of the information chosen by the use to view. The table should show all relevant information to the user.

When the user wants to add a department, the user will be prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database. When the user chooses to add a role, the user will be prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database. If the user chooses to add a new employee, the user will be prompted to enter the employee's first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database. When the user wants to update an employee role, the user will be prompted to select an employee to update and their new role. This information will then be updated in the database.

A mock-up of the database design is shown here:
